153,"Vendor Procurement","Vendor Procurement Services through IBA allows for an objective review in establishing new vendor relationships. IBA performs internal discovery, identifies the common goals for the organization, establishes the benchmarks and navigates the Request For Proposal (RFP) process. Once the vendor is selected, the IBA team follows a project plan to manage the implementation process and ensure timelines are adhered to, proactively identifying changing priorities and allocating resources accordingly. IBA provides post-implementation review of the deliverables to ensure all contract terms and any related Service Level Agreements (SLA) are met.

IBA key components to successful new vendor initiatives include:
<ul>
 	<li>Discovery</li>
 	<li>Competency Review</li>
 	<li>Contract Review</li>
 	<li>Project Plan/Implementation Oversight</li>
 	<li>Post-Review Audit of Deliverables</li>
</ul>
Our experience in new vendor implementation includes Billing and Enrollment support, Case Management, Pharmacy Benefit Management, Benefit Profiling and more."
155,"Client Services and Retention","Client Relations is the cornerstone of any organization’s success. Successful management of new clients translates into higher retention and lower administration costs. The IBA team assists organizations in identifying inconsistencies in the retention strategies and developing new strategies where none exist. IBA also works to identify cultural gaps within the organization that are impeding successful client interface.

IBA key components to improved client relations include:
<ul>
 	<li>Building a client-centric model for the organization (Cultural Integration)</li>
 	<li>Establishing common goals for and expectations of the client-facing staff</li>
 	<li>Identifying staff technical competency and training opportunities</li>
 	<li>Defining a consistent approach to new group implementation and renewals</li>
 	<li>Determining client key deliverables and exceeding those expectations</li>
</ul>
Our experience in client relationship management provides perspective on how to bring value to each client touch point to ensure that every experience is timely, accurate and value added."
157,"Corporate Project Management","Corporate Initiatives require a high level of oversight from multiple executives and senior management across multiple departments. Challenges present themselves in the form of other company initiatives, competing interests and managing other day-to-day responsibilities. IBA assumes the responsibility of collaborating to provide effective oversight of new corporate initiatives.

IBA key components to successful corporate initiatives include:
<ul>
 	<li>Identifying the resources and costs associated with the project (Scope of Project)</li>
 	<li>Building a collaborative model for the organization (Departmental Integration)</li>
 	<li>Managing all aspects of the project in a shared environment</li>
 	<li>Providing written policies and procedures on newly implemented projects</li>
</ul>
Our experience in TQM, policy and procedures and project management ensures that projects are clearly defined, goals are consistently met and policies and procedures are thoroughly documented."
160,"Administrative Services Auditing","Auditing a current vendor is always a touchy subject. The word alone implies finding things “wrong” with the way administrative services are being provided. And while we want to trust that our providers are doing their best to provide clients with accurate and compliant service, the final proof is still in the audit results.

IBA offers a way to provide an impartial third-party look at how your vendors are measuring up. We know where to look and how to effectively message the findings as process improvement opportunities while taking you and your client out of the middle of having these difficult conversations.

IBA key components to a successful audit initiative include:
<ul>
 	<li>Performing an audit that is minimally intrusive but maximizes discoveries</li>
 	<li>Reporting of discoveries/deficiencies in a comprehensive way</li>
 	<li>Delivering a clear set of next steps: suggested language changes, policy/procedure updates and governance reporting</li>
</ul>
Our experience is in knowing where opportunities are most likely to exist. The result is process improvements that translate into future cost savings and potentially avoiding compliance issue"

165,"Stop Loss Procurement","Effective underwriting and the right stop loss product is critical to ensuring that cash flow is effectively managed and an employer’s assets are protected. IBA works to understand what the employer’s short and long-term goals are. Is the focus on fixed costs, maximum claim exposure or some combination? Is employee engagement via wellness requirements an option? Will the employer’s cash flow better fit with a monthly budgeted amount or are spikes in claim costs easily absorbed? IBA performs internal discovery, identifies the financial goals for the organization, and shops the most competitive stop loss markets and related products to secure competitive pricing.

IBA has access to several carriers and stop loss products* and services including:
<ul>
 	<li>Traditional Stop Loss with Specific and Aggregate coverage or Aggregate Only coverage</li>
 	<li>Level Funding coverage</li>
 	<li>Captive Stop Loss coverage</li>
 	<li>VEBA coverage</li>
</ul>
Our A+ rated stop loss partners canvas the right market for the best fit based on industry, demographics, logistics and other considerations.

*Voluntary/Mandatory individual underwriting applications are available on certain products."
167,"Plan Design Review","Plan Design decisions are at the foundation of remaining competitive in the market. Employers want to offer a comprehensive benefits package while at the same time ensuring that plans are sustainable. A strategically designed self-funded plan achieves both. Whether employers are moving from a fully insured plan to a self-funded plan with IBA or from a self-funded administrator to IBA, it is important to benchmark all aspects of a plan design to determine benefit relevance and compliance.

IBA key components to improved plan design:
<ul>
 	<li>Introducing industry leading Care Management and Disease Management programs</li>
 	<li>Employing carve-out benefits for high dollar claims such as Dialysis and Transplants</li>
 	<li>Providing comprehensive pharmacy benefit programs for prescription costs</li>
 	<li>Implementing high-tech radiology service alternatives</li>
 	<li>Incorporating best practice language for coordinating benefits</li>
 	<li>Incentivizing members with lower out-of-pocket costs when redirecting care</li>
 	<li>Introducing, monitoring and measuring wellness programs and resulting outcomes</li>
</ul>
IBA’s experience in benefit design assists in the creation of medical, prescription and ancillary benefits that encourage and support cost-containment and long-term sustainability."
169,"Enrollment and Fulfillment","<strong>E</strong>ducational <strong>A</strong>ssistance <strong>S</strong>implifies <strong>E</strong>nrollment

IBA’s approach ensures effective communications for employer and member alike. IBA works to understand the culture of the organization and creates specific messaging to make the transition experience as seamless as possible. IBA collaborates with the agent, employer, employees and members to provide an effective rollout of the benefits package.

E.A.S.E. components for a successful enrollment include:
<ul>
 	<li>Developing tailored easy to understand welcome kits and enrollment instructions</li>
 	<li>Identifying and emphasizing important plan design changes</li>
 	<li>Providing both paper and on-line enrollment resources</li>
 	<li>Holding informational group and individual open enrollment sessions</li>
 	<li>Tracking and monitoring outstanding enrollments</li>
 	<li></li>
</ul>
The EASE protocols ensure the employer, employees and dependents understand the process and have the necessary tools to enroll timely and provides consistency in handling ongoing adds/changes/terminations."
173,"Claim Administration and Compliance","Aggressive claim review provides cost containment and translates to managing fixed cost and stop loss premium increases. IBA’s claim processing system logic partnered with additional independent review points provides three levels of claim editing. This comprehensive approach to claim payment ensures that every procedure is appropriate and every dollar spent is justified. IBA vendor partners integrate with the claim logic to maximize savings and minimize claim payment errors.

IBA operations include:
<ul>
 	<li>Reviewing for appropriateness of billing</li>
 	<li>Investigating for potential third-party liability</li>
 	<li>Benchmarking best practices and fees for similar diagnoses and procedures</li>
 	<li>Monitoring trends in dashboard reporting</li>
 	<li>Delivering comprehensive and robust claim reporting</li>
 	<li>Ensuring legislative compliance (e.g. ACA, HIPAA, COBRA, IRC 125)</li>
</ul>
Deploying multiple review edits and the best-in-industry standards results in trend well below industry average. Ensuring compliance avoids penalties and other service issues for the employer."

182,"Post-65 Medical Products","IBA evaluated carriers throughout the country that offer either replacement coverage to traditional Medicare Parts A &amp; B coverage or options to coordinate with traditional Medicare Parts A &amp; B coverage.  We chose to partner with carriers that demonstrate flexibility in plan design, provide top-notch service and deliver lower than average medical trend renewals. We formed partnerships with carriers that lower retiree premiums and stretch employer stipend dollars.

IBA has access to several fully insured medical coverage carriers and options including:
<ul>
 	<li>Group medical coverage down to 2 lives</li>
 	<li>Copay and coinsurance options</li>
 	<li>Dental, Hearing and Vision options</li>
 	<li>Holistic benefit options, such as Acupuncture and Chiropractic care</li>
 	<li>Choice of Age Banded or Composite rating</li>
</ul>
Important to those who travel, these programs offer freedom of choice with no network limitations and national access to providers and hospitals."
185,"Post-65 Prescription Products","IBA vetted access to fully insured carriers offering multiple prescription coverage options and varying formularies. From stand-alone prescription drug programs (PDP) to integrated medical and prescription drug coverage (MAPD), we  canvassed the market -- comparing pricing and formulary coverage to ensure the best price with the least disruption for your retirees. Popular alternatives including Employer Group Waiver Plans (EGWP) are easier for employers and retirees to understand and navigate.

Prescription coverage carriers and options include:
<ul>
 	<li>Group prescription coverage down to 2 lives</li>
 	<li>National retail network and mail order options</li>
 	<li>Multiple prescription copay and coinsurance options</li>

These programs offer retirees national retail networks and mail order options for convenience and portability."

231,"Self funded versus fully-funded","<b>Fully insured </b><b>health carriers </b><b>charge </b><b><i>set monthly premiums </i></b><b>regardless of </b><b>the actual </b><b>claim </b><b>costs incurred by covered members. Self-funding </b><b>allows an employer to pay </b><b><i>for only the claims incurred </i></b><b>by its covered members. </b>

<b>Self-funded coverage </b><b>consists of monthly claims </b><b>costs, reinsurance </b><b>(stop loss) premium </b><b>and third party </b><b>administration (TPA) </b><b>costs. Fully insured coverage consists of </b><b>set  premiums from the insurance </b><b>carrier.</b><b> </b>

<b>O</b><b>utside of continually increasing members’ out-of-pocket exposure (deductibles, copays and coinsurance) the employer has limited ability to impact annual premium increases.   </b>

&nbsp;

<b>Unlike fully insured health carriers that charge a set amount of premiums regardless of the claim costs, self-funding allows an employer to pay for only the claims incurred by its covered members.  <span style=""color: #ff6600;"">(insert graphic)</span></b>

The Role of the TPA (Third Party Administrator)

<b>A </b><b>Third Party Administrator (TPA</b><b>), like Insight Benefit Administrators, provides </b><b>overall administration of the plan. </b> <b>TPA </b><b>services are tailored to your needs and include:</b>

<b>  - </b><b>reviewing and paying claims </b>

<b>  - customer </b><b>service for covered members and the employer</b>

<b>  </b><b>- assistance with selecting appropriate </b><b>stop </b><b>loss </b>

<b>  </b><b>- access to local and national provider networks</b>

<b>  - pharmacy benefit management </b><b>(PBM) services</b>

&nbsp;

<b>Stop Loss or Reinsurance</b><b>: </b><b>Your Safety </b><b>Net</b>

<b>There are two basic types of </b><b>stop loss coverage</b><b>:</b>

<b>SPECIFIC COVERAGE: </b>

<b>  - Specific coverage is purchased to protect the employer from individual high claimants. </b><b>When an individual members’ claims reach a certain </b><b>dollar </b><b>amount, any claims above </b><b>that </b><b>are </b><b>then covered by the reinsurance carrier.</b>

<b>AGGREGATE COVERAGE:</b>

<b>  - Aggregate coverage is purchased to protect the employer from high claimants across the employer group. Any claims dollars incurred above a certain dollar amount (also known as the Attachment Point) are then covered by the reinsurance carrier. </b>"
